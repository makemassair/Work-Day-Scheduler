# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Module 7 Challenge - Work Day Scheduler. Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

## User Story

Using the code learnt so far, particularly DOM manipulation, advanced JavaScript, and integration of third party APIs, write the code required to make a daily schedule planner using dynamic HTML and CSS, powered by jQuery. Use `moment.js` to help achieve this.

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Acceptance Criteria

* Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page.
